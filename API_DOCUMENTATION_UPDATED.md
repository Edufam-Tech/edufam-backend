2. **Include JWT token** in `Authorization` header
3. **Role-based permissions** enforce access control
4. **Multi-tenant isolation** via Row Level Security
5. **Refresh token** when access token expires

### **Headers Required**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
Content-Type: application/json
```
